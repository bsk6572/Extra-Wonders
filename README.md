## UnCiv Mod Extra Wonders

Mod that adds some wonders that grant various bonuses. It is still a work in progress.

PR's, issues and testers welcome!

## Hosting
The repository that contains the mod is developed and maintained on [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/mark22k/UnCiv-Extra-Wonders). However, since UnCiv needs a copy of the mod on [GitHub](https://github.com/marek22k/Extra-Wonders) to show up in the list, there is a copy on GitHub.

## Note about the images
The images are all black and white, because UnCiv otherwise makes them black and white itself. Therefore some pictures have been changed enormously.

### Image removal
If an organization / person here owns a project and does not want me to change and use the logo, they are welcome to [open an issue](https://codeberg.org/mark22k/UnCiv-Extra-Units/issues/issues/new) and add the label `image removal`.
